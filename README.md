# Svelte Letter Animation

This project aims to mimic the letter animation effect seen in the footer section of
[offmenu.design](https://offmenu.design). The animation effect is achieved by leveraging the
`Svelte`'s builtin motion module and `Tailwindcss`.

## Developing

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eth3lbert/letter-animation.git
   cd letter-animation
   pnpm install
   pnpm run dev
   ```

## Acknowledgements

- [Offmenu.Design](https://offmenu.design) for the inspiration.
